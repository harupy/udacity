    "I selected a takeoff task. The reward function I designed is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_reward(self, done):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Uses current pose of sim to return reward.\"\"\"\n",
    "    reward_vz = np.clip(0.5 * self.sim.v[2], -1, 1)\n",

    "1. It has the positive vertical velocity\n",
    "2. It gets closer the target\n",
    "\n",
    "Because ```reward_pos``` includes x, y positions, the agent should avoid moving in the x or y direction to increase the total reward, but it didn't work out as I expected. I clipped both rewards(reward_vz and reward_pos) to prevent large updates.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "1. I used Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) which works well for continuous space and action spaces. DDPG doesn't explore for actions because it selects an action deterministically, so we need to add some noise to actions for exploration. I chose the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck noise which has some desired properties for this task. The experience replay and target Q-value technique are also used to stablize training.\n",

    "**Answer**:\n",
    "1. The hardest part for me was design the reward function on my own. DQN in much harder than CNNs and RNNs.\n",
    "2. I think the initial position is very import because if it's close to the the boundaries, the agent crashes soon and have no chance to explore action spaces. Also, the weight initialization is important because it decides action spaces the agent will explore even though we add some noise to actions."
